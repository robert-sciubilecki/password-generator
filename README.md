"This is a simple random password generator that generates passwords similar to the strong passwords suggested by Google. It uses the random module to select random characters from the string module, creates a list from those characters, shuffles the list, and then joins it to create the final output string.

This code was written as an exercise project from the '100 days of code' bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu."
